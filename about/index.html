        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>
          I’m a passionate <strong>Fullstack Developer</strong> specializing in
          React and Node.js, with a strong interest in building efficient,
          user-friendly, and scalable web applications. I enjoy turning ideas
          into functional products and continuously exploring better ways to
          solve problems through clean and modern code.

        <h2>Goals in This Program</h2>
        <p>
          My goal is to become a more well-rounded and confident developer,
          refining both my frontend and backend skills. I aim to strengthen my
          problem-solving abilities, master new technologies, and contribute to
          real-world projects that push me beyond my comfort zone.

        <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
        <p>
          One of my current challenges lies in effectively using SQL databases.
          While I’m comfortable with NoSQL systems like MongoDB, I’m working to
          deepen my understanding of relational database concepts, query
          optimization, and schema design.

        <h2>Note to Future Self</h2>
        <p>
          Keep learning, stay curious, and never lose the excitement that
          brought you into coding in the first place. Every bug fixed, every
          challenge overcome, and every new concept learned is a step forward.
          Trust the process you’re getting better every day.

        <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          Technology evolves constantly, and so should you. Embrace change, stay
          adaptable, and focus on writing code that not only works but also
          makes a difference. Collaboration, patience, and creativity are just
          as important as technical skills.
